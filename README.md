The usual Free Fire experience
Aside from all the new features you'll experience in Free Fire Advance, the game still offers a very similar experience to what fans of the saga are used to. Normally, you can play both single-player and team games. Similarly, you can occasionally enjoy some of the special game modes that will arrive later in Free Fire Max. Details such as the controls, graphics, and sound options are all identical. If you usually play the game's standard version well, you're likely to also play well on this Advance server.

The newest version of Free Fire
Free Fire Advance will allow you to enjoy the same battle royale experience you're used to but with a range of new features that will surprise even the most veteran players of the saga. But keep in mind that any progress you make on the Advance server will not be transferred to the standard version of Free Fire. This is because your user account on the Advance server is completely independent from your account on the traditional server. This means that even if you have a battle pass in the standard game, you won't be able to benefit from it in the advanced version.
